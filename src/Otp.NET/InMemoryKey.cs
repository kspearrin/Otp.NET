/// to Windows.
/// 
/// In order to use the key to compute an hmac it must be temporarily decrypted, used,
/// then re-encrypted. This does expose the key in memory for a time. If a memory dump occurs in this time
/// the plaintext key will be part of it. Furthermore, there are potentially
/// artifacts from the hmac computation, GC compaction, or any number of other leaks even after
/// the key is re-encrypted.

/// This type favors working over memory protection. If the particular platform isn't supported then,
/// unless forced by modifying the IsPlatformSupported method, it will just store the key in a standard
/// byte array.
